# Random Walk in Feature Sample Networks

Implementation of the model describe in the paper [Random Walk in Feature-Sample Networks for Semi-supervised Classification](http://www.comp.ita.br/~verri/publications/bracis-2016.pdf).

I used sparse matrix in order to prevent memory error and optimize the algorithm. I also used this implementation to develop this [paper](http://www.comp.ita.br/~verri/publications/bracis-2020.pdf)
